Theory and Measurement of Snores
Jensen, Gavriely, 1993
Studies a single mass model. Focus of part 1. The study is specialised towards obstructive sleep apnea.

Synthesis of voiced sounds from a two-mass model of the vocal cords.
Ishizaka, Flanagan, 1972
Model is two stiffness-coupled masses, generating acoustic propagation. Acoustic volume velocity through the vocal tract is computed, for a variety of vowel sounds.

Comments on the myoelastic - aerodynamic theory of phonation
Titze, 1979
Review of the theory as to how phonation occurs. Inspection of mathematical models and the forces that produce voiced sounds.

Synthesis of breathy, normal, and pressed phonation using a two-mass model with a triangular glottis
Birkholz, Kroeger, Neuschaefer-Rube, 2011
Advanced model using specialised mass groupings to synthesise advanced properties.
    This one is really easy to read.

Theoretical and experimental study of quasisteady‐flow separation within the glottis during phonation. Application to a modified two‐mass model.
Pelorson, Hirschberg, van Hassel, Wijnands, 1994
Evaluation/criticism of former assumptions in phonation models. Reevaluation, construction of a new advanced model, analysis of steady and unsteady flow.
